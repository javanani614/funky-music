""" Simple testing for the Spotify functionality
    so we don't need to click through pages to make
    sure it's working.

    Try this approach to running tests:

    From the command-line, do both of these:
    * pip install nose
    * nosetests

    nosetests automatically finds and runs tests in files starting with test_.
